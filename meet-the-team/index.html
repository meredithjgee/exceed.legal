      <h4>Kyle Grigsby</h4>
      <p>Kyle practices primarily in the areas of real estate and business law. Kyle applies his writing background and significant experience in business negotiations to advocate strongly and creatively for his clients. He understands that the business perspective can add color to legal analysis and suggest different methods for successful resolution of a dispute. Kyle competed as an 800-meter runner for Boise State Track & Field and his athletic background instilled in him a fire for healthy competition and desire to excel in his efforts.</p>
      <p>Kyle has successfully represented clients in various forms of civil litigation, most often disputes over real property boundaries, easements, title issues, business contracts, partnership disputes, and construction contracts. Kyle has also assisted with various zoning applications and probate disputes. Significant litigation experience greatly enhances Kyle’s ability to draft well-considered real estate and business contracts with litigation risk in mind. He also realizes that each contract is unique and must be tailored to a client’s specific circumstances and goals.</p>
      <p>Prior to attending law school, Kyle was Vice President of Business Development and Human Resources at one of the largest and highest-producing residential real estate teams in the country. He has a love and appreciation for Idaho land and real property, and its intersection with life and the law. His stepfather was a realtor, and his grandfather was a federal land appraiser and wildland firefighter.</p>
      <p>Prior to becoming a licensed attorney, Kyle had the opportunity to serve as a legal intern to Chief Justice Matthew Durrant of the Utah Supreme Court. Drafting preliminary court opinions, conferencing with the judge regarding the merits of arguments before the court, and observing the judge’s decision-making process was a foundational experience in building Kyle’s understanding of our court system and persuasive advocacy.</p>
      <p>During law school, Kyle was a Lead Note and Comment Editor of the BYU Law Review and graduated with honors. He also served as a research assistant for Dean Gordon Smith, a nationally renowned scholar on business law, and participated in the BYU Law and Entrepreneurship Clinic.</p>
